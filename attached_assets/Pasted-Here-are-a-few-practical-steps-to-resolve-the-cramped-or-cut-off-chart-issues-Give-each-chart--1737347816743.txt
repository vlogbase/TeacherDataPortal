Here are a few practical steps to resolve the “cramped” or “cut off” chart issues:

Give each chart’s container a stable (non-zero) height.

For example, wrap each chart in a <div className="w-full h-64"> or similar so that <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height="100%"> can fill that space correctly.
If your parent containers have no fixed height, Recharts will end up too small or squashed.
Adjust the chart’s margin/padding so axes and labels don’t get clipped.

In Recharts, you can set something like:
jsx
Copy
<BarChart 
  data={data}
  margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}
>
  {/* axes, bars, etc. */}
</BarChart>
This ensures that longer axis labels or legends have enough space.
Verify your grid or flex layout isn’t forcing a small width.

If you’re using a grid for the three charts, make sure the columns allow each chart enough horizontal space. For instance, use md:grid-cols-2 or grid-cols-3 with enough column width so the chart can expand.
If your layout sets overflow: hidden or uses absolute positioning, it might cut off part of the chart.
Move or resize the Legend if it’s overlapping.

You can adjust the legend’s position or layout with <Legend layout="horizontal" align="center" /> or place it below the chart. If you see text collisions, sometimes moving the legend below or above helps.
Shorten or rotate long axis labels.

If your axis labels or category names are very long, use the angle, textAnchor, or tickFormatter props (e.g., tick={{ angle: -45 }}) to rotate or shorten them so they don’t collide with each other.
Be sure each <ResponsiveContainer> is the outermost chart container.

Nothing else should wrap the chart with a conflicting width/height.
Example:
jsx
Copy
<div className="rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4 w-full h-64">
  <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height="100%">
    <BarChart data={data}>
      {/* …axes, bars, legends… */}
    </BarChart>
  </ResponsiveContainer>
</div>
By combining a definite container height, responsive Recharts components, and enough margins/space around the chart, you should get nicely displayed charts without cut-off labels or legends.
